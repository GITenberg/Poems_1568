<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span><i>ADVERTISEMENT</i></h2>
<p><i>My friend and publisher</i>, <i>Mr. Alfred Nutt</i>,
<i>asks me to introduce this re-issue of old work in a new
shape</i>.&nbsp; <i>At his request</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>I have to
say that nearly all the numbers contained in the present volume
are reprinted from</i> &lsquo;<i>A Book of Verses</i>&rsquo;
(1888) <i>and</i> &lsquo;<i>London Voluntaries</i>&rsquo;
(1892&ndash;3).&nbsp; <i>From the first of these I have removed
some copies of verse which seemed to me scarce worth keeping</i>;
<i>and I have recovered for it certain others from those
publications which had made room for them</i>.&nbsp; <i>I have
corrected where I could</i>, <i>added such dates as I might</i>,
<i>and</i>, <i>by re-arrangement and revision</i>, <i>done my
best to give my book</i>, <i>such as it is</i>, <i>its final
form</i>.&nbsp; <i>If any be displeased by the result</i>, <i>I
can but submit that my verses are my own</i>, <i>and that this is
how I would have them read</i>.</p>
<p><i>The work of revision has reminded me that</i>, <i>small as
is this book of mine</i>, <i>it is all in the matter of verse
that I have to show for the years between</i> 1872 <i>and</i>
1897.&nbsp; <i>A principal reason is that</i>, <i>after spending
the better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry</i>, <i>I
found myself</i> (<i>about</i> 1877) <i>so utterly unmarketable
that I had to own myself beaten in art</i>, <i>and to addict
myself to journalism for the next ten years</i>.&nbsp; <i>Came
the production by my old friend</i>, <i>Mr. H. B. Donkin</i>,
<i>in his little collection of</i>
&lsquo;<i>Voluntaries</i>&rsquo; (1888), <i>compiled for that
East-End Hospital to which he has devoted so much time and energy
and skill</i>, <i>of those unrhyming rhythms in which I had tried
to quintessentialize</i>, <i>as</i> (<i>I believe</i>) <i>one
scarce can do in rhyme</i>, <i>my impressions of the Old
Edinburgh Infirmary</i>.&nbsp; <i>They had long </i><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span><i>since
been rejected by every editor of standing in London&mdash;I had
well-nigh said in the world</i>; <i>but as soon as Mr. Nutt had
read them</i>, <i>he entreated me to look for more</i>.&nbsp;
<i>I did as I was told</i>; <i>old dusty sheaves were dragged to
light</i>; <i>the work of selection and correction was begun</i>;
<i>I burned much</i>; <i>I found that</i>, <i>after all</i>,
<i>the lyrical instinct had slept&mdash;not died</i>; <i>I
ventured</i> (<i>in brief</i>) &lsquo;<i>A Book of
Verses</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>It was received with so much interest
that I took heart once more</i>, <i>and wrote the numbers
presently reprinted from</i> &lsquo;<i>The National
Observer</i>&rsquo; <i>in the collection first</i> (1892)
<i>called</i> &lsquo;<i>The Song of the Sword</i>&rsquo; <i>and
afterwards</i> (1893), &lsquo;<i>London
voluntaries</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>If I have said nothing
since</i>, <i>it is that I have nothing to say which is not</i>,
<i>as yet</i>, <i>too personal&mdash;too personal and too a
afflicting&mdash;for utterance</i>.</p>
<p><i>For the matter of my book</i>, <i>it is there to speak for
itself</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>Here&rsquo;s a sigh to those who love
me</i><br />
<i>And a smile to those who hate</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>I refer to it for the simple pleasure of reflecting that it
has made me many friends and some enemies</i>.</p>

ENTER PATIENT</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> morning mists
still haunt the stony street;<br />
The northern summer air is shrill and cold;<br />
And lo, the Hospital, grey, quiet, old,<br />
Where Life and Death like friendly chafferers meet.<br />
Thro&rsquo; the loud spaciousness and draughty gloom<br />
A small, strange child&mdash;so ag&egrave;d yet so
young!&mdash;<br />
Her little arm besplinted and beslung,<br />
Precedes me gravely to the waiting-room.<br />
I limp behind, my confidence all gone.<br />
The grey-haired soldier-porter waves me on,<br />
And on I crawl, and still my spirits fail:<br />
A tragic meanness seems so to environ<br />
These corridors and stairs of stone and iron,<br />
Cold, naked, clean&mdash;half-workhouse and half-jail.</p>

WAITING</h3>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">square</span>, squat room
(a cellar on promotion),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drab to the soul, drab to the very daylight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plasters astray in unnatural-looking tinware;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scissors and lint and apothecary&rsquo;s jars.</p>
<p class="poetry">Here, on a bench a skeleton would writhe
from,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Angry and sore, I wait to be admitted:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait till my heart is lead upon my stomach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While at their ease two dressers do their
chores.</p>
<p class="poetry">One has a probe&mdash;it feels to me a
crowbar.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A small boy sniffs and shudders after bluestone.<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is (I think) a blunder and a shame.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fulsome fire.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
atmosphere<br />
Suggests the trail of a ghostly druggist.<br />
Dressings and lint on the long, lean table&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom are they for?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Or lie as in training for shroud and coffin.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s grim and strange.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far

BEFORE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Behold</span> me
waiting&mdash;waiting for the knife.<br />
A little while, and at a leap I storm<br />
The thick, sweet mystery of chloroform,<br />
The drunken dark, the little death-in-life.<br />
The gods are good to me: I have no wife,<br />
No innocent child, to think of as I near<br />
The fateful minute; nothing all-too dear<br />
Unmans me for my bout of passive strife.<br />
Yet am I tremulous and a trifle sick,<br />
And, face to face with chance, I shrink a little:<br />
My hopes are strong, my will is something weak.<br />
Here comes the basket?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I am ready.<br />
But, gentlemen my porters, life is brittle:<br />
You carry C&aelig;sar and his fortunes&mdash;steady!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hot and subtle through your being.</p>
<p class="poetry">And you gasp and reel and shudder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a rushing, swaying rapture,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Fade&mdash;receding&mdash;fainter&mdash;farther.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lights about you shower and tumble,<br />

<p class="poetry">Till a sudden lull accepts you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And you sound an utter darkness . . .<br />

AFTER</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Like</span> as a flamelet
blanketed in smoke,<br />
So through the an&aelig;sthetic shows my life;<br />
So flashes and so fades my thought, at strife<br />
With the strong stupor that I heave and choke<br />
And sicken at, it is so foully sweet.<br />
Faces look strange from space&mdash;and disappear.<br />
Far voices, sudden loud, offend my ear&mdash;<br />
And hush as sudden.&nbsp; Then my senses fleet:<br />
All were a blank, save for this dull, new pain<br />
That grinds my leg and foot; and brokenly<br />
Time and the place glimpse on to me again;<br />
And, unsurprised, out of uncertainty,<br />
I wake&mdash;relapsing&mdash;somewhat faint and fain,<br />
To an immense, complacent dreamery.</p>

VIGIL</h3>

Ache - - - !<br />
Ache, and the mattress,<br />
Run into boulders and hummocks,<br />
Glows like a kiln, while the bedclothes&mdash;<br />
Tumbling, importunate, daft&mdash;<br />
Ramble and roll, and the gas,<br />
Screwed to its lowermost,<br />
An inevitable atom of light,<br />
Haunts, and a stertorous sleeper<br />
Snores me to hate and despair.</p>

On . . . and still on . . . still on!</p>
<p class="poetry">Far in the stillness a cat<br />
Languishes loudly.&nbsp; A cinder<br />
Falls, and the shadows<br />
Lurch to the leap of the flame.&nbsp; The next man to me<br />
Turns with a moan; and the snorer,<br />
The drug like a rope at his throat,<br />
Gasps, gurgles, snorts himself free, as the night-nurse,<br />
Noiseless and strange,<br />
Her bull&rsquo;s eye half-lanterned in apron,<br />
(Whispering me, &lsquo;Are ye no sleepin&rsquo; yet?&rsquo;),<br

Passes, list-slippered and peering,<br />
Round . . . and is gone.</p>

A comely shape; a slim, high-coloured hand,<br />
Graced, rather oddly, with a signet ring;<br />
A bashful air, becoming everything;<br />
A well-bred silence always at command.<br />
Her plain print gown, prim cap, and bright steel chain<br />
Look out of place on her, and I remain<br />
Absorbed in her, as in a pleasant mystery.<br />
Quick, skilful, quiet, soft in speech and touch . . .<br />

Bends in inspection already.</p>

Round, square, and angular, serry and shove;<br />
While from within a voice,<br />
Gravely and weightily fluent,<br />
Sounds; and then ceases; and suddenly<br />
(Look at the stress of the shoulders!)<br />
Out of a quiver of silence,<br />
Over the hiss of the spray,<br />
Comes a low cry, and the sound<br />
Of breath quick intaken through teeth<br />
Clenched in resolve.&nbsp; And the Master<br />
Breaks from the crowd, and goes,<br />
Wiping his hands,<br />

Whistled and shouted along.</p>

Argosies heavy with fruitfulness,<br />

Loud lows the steer; in the fallows<br />
Rooks are alert; and the brooks<br />
Gurgle and tinkle and trill.&nbsp; Thro&rsquo; the gloamings,<br

Under the rare, shy stars,<br />
Boy and girl wander,<br />
Dreaming in darkness and dew.</p>

Wakes in the ward, and I sicken,<br />
Impotent, winter at heart.</p>

The brown eyes radiant with vivacity&mdash;<br />
There shines a brilliant and romantic grace,<br />
A spirit intense and rare, with trace on trace<br />
Of passion and impudence and energy.<br />
Valiant in velvet, light in ragged luck,<br />
Most vain, most generous, sternly critical,<br />
Buffoon and poet, lover and sensualist:<br />
A deal of Ariel, just a streak of Puck,<br />
Much Antony, of Hamlet most of all,<br />
And something of the Shorter-Catechist.</p>

(That wonder-working word!),<br />
Vouchsafed his back to me, and spread his vans,<br />
And soaring, soaring on<br />
From air to air, came charging to the ground<br />
Sheer, like a lark from the midsummer clouds,<br />
And, shaking me out of the saddle, where I sprawled<br />
Flicked at me with his tail,<br />
And left me blinded, miserable, distraught<br />
(Even as I was in deed,<br />
When doctors came, and odious things were done<br />
On my poor tortured eyes<br />
With lancets; or some evil acid stung<br />
And wrung them like hot sand,<br />
And desperately from room to room<br />
Fumble I must my dark, disconsolate way),<br />
To get to Bagdad how I might.&nbsp; But there<br />
I met with Merry Ladies.&nbsp; O you three&mdash;<br />
Safie, Amine, Zob&euml;id&eacute;&mdash;when my heart<br />
Forgets you all shall be forgot!<br />
And so we supped, we and the rest,<br />
On wine and roasted lamb, rose-water, dates,<br />
Almonds, pistachios, citrons.&nbsp; And Haroun<br />
Laughed out of his lordly beard<br />
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>On Giaffar
and Mesrour (<i>I</i> knew the Three<br />
For all their Mossoul habits).&nbsp; And outside<br />
The Tigris, flowing swift<br />
Like Severn bend for bend, twinkled and gleamed<br />
With broken and wavering shapes of stranger stars;<br />
The vast, blue night<br />
Was murmurous with peris&rsquo; plumes<br />
And the leathern wings of genies; words of power<br />
Were whispering; and old fishermen,<br />
Casting their nets with prayer, might draw to shore<br />
Dead loveliness: or a prodigy in scales<br />
Worth in the Caliph&rsquo;s Kitchen pieces of gold:<br />
Or copper vessels, stopped with lead,<br />
Wherein some Squire of Eblis watched and railed,<br />
In durance under potent charactry<br />
Graven by the seal of Solomon the King . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, as the Book was glassed<br />
In Life as in some olden mirror&rsquo;s quaint,<br />
Bewildering angles, so would Life<br />
Flash light on light back on the Book; and both<br />
Were changed.&nbsp; Once in a house decayed<br />
From better days, harbouring an errant show<br />
(For all its stories of dry-rot<br />
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Were
filled with gruesome visitants in wax,<br />
Inhuman, hushed, ghastly with Painted Eyes),<br />
I wandered; and no living soul<br />
Was nearer than the pay-box; and I stared<br />
Upon them staring&mdash;staring.&nbsp; Till at last,<br />
Three sets of rafters from the streets,<br />
I strayed upon a mildewed, rat-run room,<br />
With the two Dancers, horrible and obscene,<br />
Guarding the door: and there, in a bedroom-set,<br />
Behind a fence of faded crimson cords,<br />
With an aspect of frills<br />
And dimities and dishonoured privacy<br />
That made you hanker and hesitate to look,<br />
A Woman with her litter of Babes&mdash;all slain,<br />
All in their nightgowns, all with Painted Eyes<br />
Staring&mdash;still staring; so that I turned and ran<br />
As for my neck, but in the street<br />
Took breath.&nbsp; The same, it seemed,<br />
And yet not all the same, I was to find,<br />
As I went up!&nbsp; For afterwards,<br />
Whenas I went my round alone&mdash;<br />
All day alone&mdash;in long, stern, silent streets,<br />
Where I might stretch my hand and take<br />
Whatever I would: still there were Shapes of Stone,<br />
<a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>Motionless, lifelike, frightening&mdash;for the Wrath<br

Had smitten them; but they watched,<br />
This by her melons and figs, that by his rings<br />
And chains and watches, with the hideous gaze,<br />
The Painted Eyes insufferable,<br />
Now, of those grisly images; and I<br />
Pursued my best-belov&eacute;d quest,<br />
Thrilled with a novel and delicious fear.<br />
So the night fell&mdash;with never a lamplighter;<br />
And through the Palace of the King<br />
I groped among the echoes, and I felt<br />
That they were there,<br />
Dreadfully there, the Painted staring Eyes,<br />
Hall after hall . . . Till lo! from far<br />
A Voice!&nbsp; And in a little while<br />
Two tapers burning!&nbsp; And the Voice,<br />
Heard in the wondrous Word of God, was&mdash;whose?<br />
Whose but Zob&euml;id&eacute;&rsquo;s,<br />
The lady of my heart, like me<br />
A True Believer, and like me<br />
An outcast thousands of leagues beyond the pale! . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">Or, sailing to the Isles<br />
Of Khaledan, I spied one evenfall<br />
A black blotch in the sunset; and it grew<br />
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Swiftly .
. . and grew.&nbsp; Tearing their beards,<br />
The sailors wept and prayed; but the grave ship,<br />
Deep laden with spiceries and pearls, went mad,<br />
Wrenched the long tiller out of the steersman&rsquo;s hand,<br />
And, turning broadside on,<br />
As the most iron would, was haled and sucked<br />
Nearer, and nearer yet;<br />
And, all awash, with horrible lurching leaps<br />
Rushed at that Portent, casting a shadow now<br />
That swallowed sea and sky; and then,<br />
Anchors and nails and bolts<br />
Flew screaming out of her, and with clang on clang,<br />
A noise of fifty stithies, caught at the sides<br />
Of the Magnetic Mountain; and she lay,<br />
A broken bundle of firewood, strown piecemeal<br />
About the waters; and her crew<br />
Passed shrieking, one by one; and I was left<br />
To drown.&nbsp; All the long night I swam;<br />
But in the morning, O, the smiling coast<br />
Tufted with date-trees, meadowlike,<br />
Skirted with shelving sands!&nbsp; And a great wave<br />
Cast me ashore; and I was saved alive.<br />
So, giving thanks to God, I dried my clothes,<br />
And, faring inland, in a desert place<br />
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>I stumbled
on an iron ring&mdash;<br />
The fellow of fifty built into the Quays:<br />
When, scenting a trap-door,<br />
I dug, and dug; until my biggest blade<br />
Stuck into wood.&nbsp; And then,<br />
The flight of smooth-hewn, easy-falling stairs,<br />
Sunk in the naked rock!&nbsp; The cool, clean vault,<br />
So neat with niche on niche it might have been<br />
Our beer-cellar but for the rows<br />
Of brazen urns (like monstrous chemist&rsquo;s jars)<br />
Full to the wide, squat throats<br />
With gold-dust, but a-top<br />
A layer of pickled-walnut-looking things<br />
I knew for olives!&nbsp; And far, O, far away,<br />
The Princess of China languished!&nbsp; Far away<br />
Was marriage, with a Vizier and a Chief<br />
Of Eunuchs and the privilege<br />
Of going out at night<br />
To play&mdash;unkenned, majestical, secure&mdash;<br />
Where the old, brown, friendly river shaped<br />
Like Tigris shore for shore!&nbsp; Haply a Ghoul<br />
Sat in the churchyard under a frightened moon,<br />
A thighbone in his fist, and glared<br />
At supper with a Lady: she who took<br />
Her rice with tweezers grain by grain.<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Or you
might stumble&mdash;there by the iron gates<br />
Of the Pump Room&mdash;underneath the limes&mdash;<br />
Upon Bedreddin in his shirt and drawers,<br />
Just as the civil Genie laid him down.<br />
Or those red-curtained panes,<br />
Whence a tame cornet tenored it throatily<br />
Of beer-pots and spittoons and new long pipes,<br />
Might turn a caravansery&rsquo;s, wherein<br />
You found Noureddin Ali, loftily drunk,<br />
And that fair Persian, bathed in tears,<br />
You&rsquo;d not have given away<br />
For all the diamonds in the Vale Perilous<br />
You had that dark and disleaved afternoon<br />
Escaped on a roc&rsquo;s claw,<br />
Disguised like Sindbad&mdash;but in Christmas beef!<br />
And all the blissful while<br />
The schoolboy satchel at your hip<br />
Was such a bulse of gems as should amaze<br />
Grey-whiskered chapmen drawn<br />
From over Caspian: yea, the Chief Jewellers<br />
Of Tartary and the bazaars,<br />
Seething with traffic, of enormous Ind.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus cried, thus called aloud, to the child

Of the sober, workaday hours<br />
They saw, week in week out, pass, and still pass<br />
In the sleepy Minster City, folded kind<br />
In ancient Severn&rsquo;s arm,<br />
Amongst her water-meadows and her docks,<br />
Whose floating populace of ships&mdash;<br />
Galliots and luggers, light-heeled brigantines,<br />
Bluff barques and rake-hell fore-and-afters&mdash;brought<br />
To her very doorsteps and geraniums<br />

Like fire on some high errand of the race;<br />
The irresistible appeals<br />
For comradeship that sound<br />
Steadily from the irresistible sea.<br />
Thus the East laughed and whispered, and the tale,<br />
Telling itself anew<br />

Took on the colours, busked it in the wear<br />

On some poor collier-hamlet&mdash;(mound on mound<br />

Sullenly smoking over a row<br />
Of flat-faced hovels; black in the gritty air<br />
A web of rails and wheels and beams; with strings<br />
Of hurtling, tipping trams)&mdash;<br />
As on the amorous nightingales<br />

We bowled along a road that curved a spine<br />
Superbly sinuous and serpentine<br />
Thro&rsquo; silent symphonies of summer green.<br />
Sudden the Forth came on us&mdash;sad of mien,<br />
No cloud to colour it, no breeze to line:<br />
A sheet of dark, dull glass, without a sign<br />
Of life or death, two spits of sand between.<br />
Water and sky merged blank in mist together,<br />
The Fort loomed spectral, and the Guardship&rsquo;s spars<br />
Traced vague, black shadows on the shimmery glaze:<br />
We felt the dim, strange years, the grey, strange weather,<br />
The still, strange land, unvexed of sun or stars,<br />
Where Lancelot rides clanking thro&rsquo; the haze.</p>

Her lip is red, her cheek is golden-white,<br />
Her nose a scimitar; and, set aside<br />
The bamboo hat she cocks with so much pride,<br />
Her dress a dream of daintiness and delight.<br />
And when she passes with the dreadful boys<br />
And romping girls, the cockneys loud and crude,<br />
My thought, to the Minories tied yet moved to range<br />
The Land o&rsquo; the Sun, commingles with the noise<br />
Of magian drums and scents of sandalwood<br />
A touch Sidonian&mdash;modern&mdash;taking&mdash;strange!</p>

A wide blue cloak, a squat and sturdy throng<br />

A white vest broidered black, her person deck,<br />
Nor seems their picked, stern, old-world quaintness wrong.<br />
Her great creel forehead-slung, she wanders nigh,<br />
Easing the heavy strap with gnarled, brown fingers,<br />
The spirit of traffic watchful in her eye,<br />
Ever and anon imploring you to buy,<br />
As looking down the street she onward lingers,<br />
Reproachful, with a strange and doleful cry.</p>

Stared dim towards the blue immensity,<br />

Of life in death&rsquo;s own likeness&mdash;Life bereft<br />
Of living looks as by the Great Release&mdash;<br />
Pass to an exquisite night&rsquo;s more exquisite close!</p>
<p class="poetry">Reach upon reach of burial&mdash;so they

These colonies of dreams!&nbsp; And as we steal<br />
Homeward together, but for the buxom breeze,<br />
Fitfully frolicking to heel<br />
With news of dawn-drenched woods and tumbling seas,<br />
We might&mdash;thus awed, thus lonely that we are&mdash;<br />
Be wandering some dispeopled star,<br />
Some world of memories and unbroken graves,<br />
So broods the abounding Silence near and far:<br />
Till even your footfall craves<br />
Forgiveness of the majesty it braves.</p>

ancient Strand<br />

And sauntering, takes his way<br />
This golden end of afternoon,<br />
As though the corn stood yellow in all the land,<br />
And the ripe apples dropped to the harvest-moon.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lo! the round sun, half-down the western

Seen as along an unglazed telescope&mdash;<br />
Lingers and lolls, loth to be done with day:<br />
Gifting the long, lean, lanky street<br />
And its abounding confluences of being<br />
With aspects generous and bland;<br />
Making a thousand harnesses to shine<br />
As with new ore from some enchanted mine,<br />
And every horse&rsquo;s coat so full of sheen<br />

And even the roar<br />
Of the strong streams of toil, that pause and pour<br />
Eastward and westward, sounds suffused&mdash;<br />
Seems as it were bemused<br />
And blurred, and like the speech<br />
Of lazy seas on a lotus-haunted beach&mdash;<br />

Shines like an angel-market.&nbsp; High aloft<br />
Over his couchant Lions, in a haze<br />
Shimmering and bland and soft,<br />

Our Sailor takes the golden gaze<br />
Of the saluting sun, and flames superb,<br />
As once he flamed it on his ocean round.<br />
The dingy dreariness of the picture-place,<br />
Turned very nearly bright,<br />
Takes on a luminous transiency of grace,<br />

Of the long, varying year,<br />
Shares in the universal alms of light.<br />

Look! as she turns her glancing head,<br />
A call of gold is floated from her ear!<br />
Golden, all golden!&nbsp; In a golden glory,<br />
Long-lapsing down a golden coasted sky,<br />
The day, not dies but, seems<br />
Dispersed in wafts and drifts of gold, and shed<br />
Upon a past of golden song and story<br />
And memories of gold and golden dreams.</p>

And those mild messages the Stars<br />
Descend in silver silences and dews;<br />
Or what the sweet-breathing West,<br />
Wanton with wading in the swirl of the wheat,<br />
Said, and their leafage laughed;<br />
And how the wet-winged Angel of the Rain<br />
Came whispering . . . whispering; and the gifts of the
Year&mdash;<br />
The sting of the stirring sap<br />
Under the wizardry of the young-eyed Spring,<br />
Their summer amplitudes of pomp,<br />
Their rich autumnal melancholy, and the shrill,<br />
Embittered housewifery<br />
Of the lean Winter: all such things,<br />
And with them all the goodness of the Master,<br />
<a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>Whose
right hand blesses with increase and life,<br />
Whose left hand honours with decay and death.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus under the constraint of Night<br />
These gross and simple creatures,<br />
Each in his scores of rings, which rings are years,<br />
A servant of the Will!<br />
And God, the Craftsman, as He walks<br />
The floor of His workshop, hearkens, full of cheer<br />
In thus accomplishing<br />
The aims of His miraculous artistry.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
