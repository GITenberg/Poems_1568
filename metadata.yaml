description: '"British poet, critic and editor, Henley''s verse is known for its bravado
  and spirit of defiance, yet it could be equally delicate and lyrical. His best-known
  poems include England, My England, and Invictus, which concludes with the famous
  lines I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. Nearly all of the
  poems contained in this volume are reprinted from A Book of Verses and London Voluntaries.
  He has divided the poems into the following headings: In Hospital; Bric-A-Brac;
  Echoes; London Voluntaries; A Song of Speed; and Rhymes and Rhythms."--'
